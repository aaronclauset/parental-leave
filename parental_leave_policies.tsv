A regular faculty member (tenure-track, teaching-track, librarian and archivist-track and research-track) who is the parent of a newborn child, or who has adopted a child of pre-school age, and who is the primary care giver of the child, is entitled to a one semester paid leave of absence. Teaching or other duties that would otherwise be carried out during the period of leave may not be shifted to other semesters against the wishes of the person taking such paid leave. Tenure-track faculty members without tenure who take a one-semester paid parental leave, may, at their discretion, exclude one year from current service for the purpose of determining the tenure decision deadline. Reappointment and promotion clocks may similarly be delayed by one year for all regular faculty taking one semester of paid parental leave.	2/22/18
